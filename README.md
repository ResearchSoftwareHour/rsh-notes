# Notes for [Research Software Hour](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/)

Our program will evolve as our audience likes, but below are some of
our initial ideas.  You can suggest more in issues in the
[rsh-notes repository](https://github.com/ResearchSoftwareHour/rsh-notes).

Each week, we want to do some simple stuff, some advanced stuff, some
stuff more towards software/programming, some stuff more towards
scientific computing/Linux.

### Research programming
Our first focus is research software skills, such as:

- a tour of the Rust programming language
- profiling code for CPU and memory bottlenecks
- workflow management
- pair programming with our normal work
- CMake best practices
- demonstrating few Python packages that we use all the time

### Scientific computing support skills

There are tons of related tools for working with code:

- go through git usage
- adding automated testing to a repo
- moving documentation from X to readthedocs
- working with pip/conda for Python
- how we use GitHub

### Evaluate *your* own code

We can take the code from a listener, go through it, discuss and
improve it.  Suggest by opening an issue in this repository.

- The code should have some open license, so that we can distribute it
  to our viewers and add it to our materials.  In return, we
  distribute our improvements back to you.
- We should be able to understand the gist of it quickly, and provide
  some feedback to our community.


### Other courses
Go through sections of other courses, such as
- [coderefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)
- High-performance computing

## Unix tools

Linux/Unix is the key to what we do, and having a good grasp of it
will improve almost all of your work (whatever operating system you use):

- porting to an HPC system / using our HPC systems
- bash, ssh, shell scripting, etc.
- tmux/screen
- getopts
- git-pr

### Data management

Everything is data, and sometimes your software problems are actually
data problems:

- data management
- data repositories
- data formats, feather format.
- optimizing data i/o
- how to open source a code

### Open science and reproducibility

Good software leads to good open science, and vice versa:

- how to get a DOI
- reprohack
- docker containers: how to run an image, how to containerize something
- getting your Python project to PyPI

### Discussion time

We answer any questions our watchers may have.  Try to stump us!
