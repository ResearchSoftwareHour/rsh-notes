# Visitor checklist

Thank you for your interest in being a guest on Research Software
Hour.  We want to make this a good experience for everyone, thus we
outline here what you can expect.  This is carefully controlled
education and entertainment, you will know exactly what you are
getting into in advance and we will have a friendly atmosphere.

There are different ways you can join:
- Be interviewed as someone working in the field
- Be a special guest who teaches some topic
- other?



## Before the show

- How do you want to be **credited**?  Please give name as it will be
  written and name as it will be written in the schedule
- Tell us anything in particular you would like us **to ask or not
  ask**.
- Can you come up with a clever icebreaker and/or question you want us
  to ask you?
- We'll probably ask you **what do you know now about scientific
  computing, that you wish someone had told you when you first
  started?**.  Think of an answer, or tell us if you don't want us to
  ask.
- We'll arrange a some **preparation calls** the days before, to both
  go through the topics and test the tech.
- We'll probably make a detailed outline of what we will talk about.
  This is education and entertainment, and we carefully plan for
  both.
- We use Jitsi Meet (meet.jit.si) - we know it at least runs in the
  Chrome web browser well.  You'll have one Jitsi session for the
  camera, and a *separate* one for audio.  We'll go over this in
  detail during the practice session a few days before.
- We have [community
  standards](https://researchsoftwarehour.github.io/watch/) -
  basically, make a good environment.



## Privacy and experience

- Check what is in your camera's background.  You might want to
  clean it up some.  Remove everything you can and make sure it
  looks presentable (but it's up to you).
- Try to have a relatively quiet location.
- Tell others in your location that you will be recording - warn
  them to stay out of the camera's field of view and to not make too
  much noise.
- Be aware of private content anywhere on your screen - preferably,
  close anything you don't need.
- Light makes a big different for quality (more photos = better
  quality).  Try to not have light behind you.  I find that light
  shining on the wall in front of you, reflecting onto you, works
  well.
- A good internet connection also makes huge differences in quality.



## Broadcast agreement

**Please send us an email, in your own words, indicating that:**
- You understand your voice (+image if so) will be broadcasted on
  Twitch and published on Youtube.
- Publishing is non-revocable (the Youtube video will be permanently
  available)
- The content will be licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
- You will follow the Twitch terms of service and good community
  standards.



## Preparation right before the broadcast

- Plan to connect 30 minutes before to do tech setup.  Stream goes
  live 15 minutes before with title card, and 10 minutes before with
  our pre-steam discussion beginning.
- In the preparation session, we will discuss if you are there during
  the pre-show session or not.  But either way we need to set the tech
  up 30 minutes early.



## During the broadcast

- We find that it's best to keep the discussion going quickly, without
  any one person talking too long at once.
- So, we try to speak with pauses, and interrupt each other with
  questions or comments often.  This makes it seem like a discussion,
  not a lecture.  It also relieves the pressure for coming up with
  what to say.
- Let us know if you have any specific requests or needs.
- We post the video to Youtube right after the broadcast - let us know
  right away if you need us to delay.
